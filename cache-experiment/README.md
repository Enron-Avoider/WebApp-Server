# Cache Experiment

This is a playground for experimenting with cache.

It has 2 servers: 1 graphql and  1 node.
Our main objective it to cache requests made to node server on the graphql one.
Currently we implemented our own solution for this as Graphql's where behaving well for this.
But we will revisit this and continue to work on it as it's important for scale.
